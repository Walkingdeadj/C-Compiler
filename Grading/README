        -Grading/README
        -Documentation/Developer.tex
    
    Building instructions
        Running under Source folder
        make                  //Build mycc.o Developer.pdf(in the Documentation folder)

        ./mycc                //Output standard error as required
        ./mycc -0             //Output mode 0 (Verision info only for part 0)
        ./mycc -0 -o          //Output error message
        ./mycc -0 -o out.txt  //Output txt file in the Source folder and write version info in the file
    
    Notes:
        -All functionality achieved as part 0 HW described
        -Currently no invalid txt extension file error message and checker since no requirement for this part
        -All .tex generated files will be out to the Documentation folder.
